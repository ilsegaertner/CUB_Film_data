# Name: CUB Film data
## An Arthouse database 

### A complete web application (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript technologies

### The project demonstrates mastery of full-stack JavaScript development, including APIs, web server frameworks, databases, business logic, authentication and data security



### Overview

CUB Film Data is an app built as part of my CareerFoundry's Full-Stack-Web-Development-Course to demonstrate the mastery of full-stack JavaScript development inside the MERN stack. 

The web app allows users to load information about specific arthouse movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies. 

The API is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/ilsegaertner/CUB_Film_data).

### Objective

The objectiv was to build the server-side for a movie database application from scratch. 

### Approach
 
**Server-Side:**

The development of the project was achieved through the creation of a REST API via Node.js and Express. 
Individual conceptualized endpoints for the API were allocated and can be accessed through common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Via Mongoose the data of the users and the movies are connected to a specifically developed non-relational database (MongoDB). 
In the code for the endpoints authentication and authorization is implemented. The API is modified to align with data security regulations.

Finally, the API and the database were deployed to an online hosting service and a cloud-based database hosting platform.

### Features 

- Return a list of ALL movies to the user 
- Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user
- Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”)
- Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name
- Allow new users to register
- Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
- Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
- Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
- Allow existing users to deregister 



### Challenges

I really enjoyed working with detail-oriented database topics. I built this app from the ground up while learning the key concepts of backend programming.

As being completely new to backend processes this task was challenging, and at the same time very enriching.

As a visual person, I kind of needed some time to make the invisible processes of server-side programming obvious. After finalising the app I learnt that I like databases, and that I can see  eagerness towards projects in this directions.
